# Getting started VS code and C programming language

#### By Vanshika Sinha

## Part-1: Practicing input and output

This part is a way to get started with Visual Studio Code and the C programming language by giving the name and age of the user as inputs and then printing these results as outputs.

## Part-2: A simple CSV parser

This part involves reading of a CSV file and splitting it up into its constituent fields and records and then using the parser to load the datasets.

## Part-3: Handle quote marks

This part involves extending the function from Part-2 to handle the quoted fields by maintaining a boolean which is true inside the quotes and false otherwise.

## Part-4: Wrap it all up

This part involves extending the parser to store the data in a struct.
